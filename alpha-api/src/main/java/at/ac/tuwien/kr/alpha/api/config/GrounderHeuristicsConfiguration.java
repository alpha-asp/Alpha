/**
 *
 * Both parameters {@link #toleranceConstraints} and {@link #toleranceRules} are interpreted as follows:
 * A rule (or constraint) is grounded if the following conditions are satisfied:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>All variables in the rule are bound (either by positive body literals that are already
 *      satisfied, or because the whole rule is ground).</li>
 * 	<li>No atom occurring positively in the body is assigned F.</li>
 * 	<li>No atom occurring negatively in the body is true as a fact.
 * 		(Note: The rule is still grounded if an atom occurring negatively in the body is assigned true without
 * 		being a fact, because the alternative would necessitate triggering re-grounding during backtracking.)</li>
 * 	<li>At most {@code N} atoms occurring positively in the body are still unassigned.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The parameter {@link #toleranceConstraints} specifies {@code N} for constraints, while {@link #toleranceRules}
 * specifies {@code N} for all other rules. Infinity is represented by the value {@code -1}.
 * The default value for both parameters is {@code 0}, which means that only those rules and constraints are
 * grounded whose positive body is already satisfied.
 *
 * The additional parameter {@link #accumulatorEnabled} is a switch for the accumulator grounding strategy
 * which disables the removal of instances from the grounder memory in certain cases.
