/**
 * One weakness of Alpha that has to be addressed in future work is its lack of support nogoods (except in one special case).
 * This means that the solver cannot recognize when an atom occurring negatively in a rule body cannot be satisfied anymore,
 * thus exploring large portions of the search space in search for a witness.
 * Therefore, Alpha currently benefits in many cases from heuristics that assign true to choice points whenever they can.
 * We apply this modification to {@link DependencyDrivenHeuristic}, which then always assigns true first and tries false
 * only when backtracking, and call these variants <i>pyromaniacal</i> since they prefer the firing of a rule over its non-firing.
