/**
 * {@link DependencyDrivenHeuristic} needs to know a lot about the structure of nogoods, i.e. the role their members play in rules.
 * However, the solving component of Alpha usually deals only with nogoods and cannot naturally access this information.
 * Therefore, {@link GeneralizedDependencyDrivenHeuristic} both generalizes and simplifies {@link DependencyDrivenHeuristic}
 * by redefining the set of atoms dependent on a choice point.
 * This set is constructed by adding to it, every time a new nogood containing a choice point is added to the stack,
 * all other atoms in the nogood.
 * To choose an atom, {@link GeneralizedDependencyDrivenHeuristic} then proceeds as {@link DependencyDrivenHeuristic}.
 * Because {@link GeneralizedDependencyDrivenHeuristic} does not know the head belonging to a choice point,
 * it just uses the {@link BerkMin} method to choose a truth value.
