/**
 * Implementation of {@link AbstractLiteralInstantiationStrategy} designed for use in {@link NaiveGrounder}.
 * 
 * The instantiation strategy shares a {@link WorkingMemory}, an {@link AtomStore}, an {@link Assignment}, a {@link Map} of atoms that were
 * facts of the currently grounded program, as well as a list of {@link Atom}s that should be lazily deleted from the working memory, with
 * the grounder.
 * 
 * The working memory and the facts map are maintained by the grounder and are being read by
 * {@link DefaultLazyGroundingInstantiationStrategy} in order to determine {@link AssignmentStatus}es for atoms. The {@link AtomStore} is
 * maintained by {@link DefaultLazyGroundingInstantiationStrategy} in the sense that atoms created from newly encountered ground instances
 * are added by the instantiation strategy. The {@link Assignment} reflects the {@link Solver}s "current view of the world". It is used by
 * {@link DefaultLazyGroundingInstantiationStrategy} to determine {@link AssignmentStatus}es for atoms.
 * 
 * A specialty of this implementation is that - since deletion of obsolete {@link Atom}s from {@link NaiveGrounder}s {@link WorkingMemory}
 * happens lazily (i.e. at the end of each run of {@link NaiveGrounder#getNoGoods(Assignment)}) - it maintains a set of "stale" atoms that
 * is shared with the grounder. Specifically, whenever {@link DefaultLazyGroundingInstantiationStrategy#getAssignmentStatusForAtom(Atom)}
 * determines that an {@link Atom} is {@link AssignmentStatus#UNASSIGNED} or {@link AssignmentStatus#FALSE}, that {@link Atom} is added to
 * the stale atom set, which in turn is processed by the grounder, which then deletes the respective atoms from the working memory.
